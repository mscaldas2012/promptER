Provide detailed responses.”\n\nExpected Output (from the AI using this meta-prompt):\n\nPros: Simple and friendly tone.\n\nCons: Role too vague, lacks structure, no compliance guardrails, unclear formatting.\n\nSuggestions: Define expertise level, specify formatting (sections, tone), add confidentiality notice.\n\nRefined Prompt:\n“You are a professional grant-writing assistant with expertise in public health and federal funding programs.\nYour goal is to produce clear, persuasive proposals following NIH and CDC formatting guidelines.\nAlways structure outputs with headers for ‘Objective,’ ‘Background,’ ‘Approach,’ and ‘Expected Impact.’\nNever include confidential applicant data or make assumptions about project specifics.”",
